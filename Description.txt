The GUI of this AIMMS project illustrates the use of a network object with a background and data/names are filled in at particular points. 
- Choose left or right perspective in order to order the reindeer either using the order in the set of left reindeer (Lefty) or right reindeer (Righty).
- Choose a solution to view a different solution.
